                <h2>Understanding Self-Harm</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <h3>What is self-harm?</h3>
                    <p>Many people think of cutting or burning one’s skin as self-harm. But there are many other self-harming behaviours, including self-neglect and risky behaviour. The definition of self-harm is <strong>behaviour with intention of harming oneself</strong>. This can include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>cutting, hitting or burning oneself</li>
                        <li>intentionally missing prescribed medication doses or purposefully taking too much</li>
                        <li>picking and scratching at skin</li>
                        <li>taking undue risk, such as overuse of alcohol, drug use, or risky sexual behaviour</li>
                        <li>over-eating or under-eating</li>
                        <li>excessive exercise</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Who self-harms?</h3>
                    <p>Anyone can show self-harming behaviour, although  it is most common in adolescents and young adults, and people struggling with mental illness. Self-harm behaviour may be a sign that someone is struggling to cope.</p>
                    <h3>Why do people self-harm?</h3>
                    <p>Some people struggle to cope with their distress and feel that hurting themselves is the only way to manage their emotions.</p>
                    <div class="speech-bubble left">
                        <p>"It made me feel in control"</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="speech-bubble-container right">
                        <div class="speech-bubble right">
                            <p>"I felt angry at myself and couldn't express it"</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Self-harming behaviour may be a reaction to life circumstances, a way to cope, a compulsion, or a grasp at control.</p>
                    <p>Some people may not understand why they self-harm, or struggle naming their feelings. Some people report feeling relief after self-harming, while others say self-harm helps them manage strong emotions like anger or panic. Self-harm may be used to punish oneself or distract from internal pain or numbness. Whatever the reason, <strong>learning what triggers an urge</strong> to self-harm can help someone learn to manage emotions without using self-harm.</p>
					<p>Because self-harming behaviour can produce satisfaction or relief, it can feel addictive. Self-harm can be a difficult pattern to stop, and people may relapse after stopping self-harm behaviour.</p>

                <h2>Myths about self-harm</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <h3>Are people who self-harm suicidal?</h3>
					<p>Not necessarily, although people who self-harm are higher risk for accidental suicide. People who self-harm are more likely to experience suicidal ideation, and it is important to be aware of this risk.</p>
					<h3>Is self-harm a way to get attention?</h3>
					<p>Language like ‘attention-seeking’ can be stigmatising and stop people from seeking support. It is often assumed that self-harm is a cry for attention, but many people will self-harm in secret and feel guilty or ashamed about asking for help or medical care. </p>
					<p>However, some people self-harm to show how they’re feeling or to be taken seriously about their distress. Self-harm does suggest that the person is struggling, and is a sign that they may benefit from support.</p>
					<p>Injuries caused by self-harm must be looked after and may require medical attention.<strong>Remember, everyone is deserving of support.</strong></p>
            <div class="section">
                <h2>Managing your self-harm</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
					<h3>I'm struggling, what do I do?</h3>
                    <p>It can be really difficult to open up about self-harm. Taking the step to talk to someone can be scary and it can be hard to find the words. But asking for help is your first step in accessing support.</p>
                    <p><strong>“I’m struggling and I’d like to talk to you about it. I’ve been hurting myself to cope.”</strong></p>
                    <p>Some people you can to talk to are family, friends, your doctor, someone at your school or workplace, or charities and helplines - check out the sidebar or Helplines tab for links.</p>
					
					<h3>Techniques to try</h3>
					<p>You may find it helpful to distract yourself from the urge to self-harm, or replace self-harming behaviours with safer options that create a different physical sensation.</p>
					<p>These may include:</p>
					<ul>
                        <li>Holding an ice cube in your fist</li>
                        <li>Pinging an elastic band against your skin</li>
                        <li>Eating sour sweets or spicy food</li>
                        <li>Running your hands under cold water</li>
						<li>Listening to music</li>
						<li>Going on a walk</li>
						<li>Drawing on yourself</li>
                    </ul>
					
				</div>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>For those supporting someone who is self-harming</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <h3>I'm worried about someone, what do I do?</h3>
                    <p>If you are worried about someone, there is support available for you and them. It is normal to feel upset or overwhelmed when you are worried about a loved one engaging in self-harming behaviour. </p>
					<p>It may be difficult to start a conversation. However, it is important to ask in plain language whether they are self-harming and whether they are experiencing suicidal thoughts. </p>
					<p><strong>“I’ve noticed something and I’m worried about you. Are you hurting yourself?”</strong></p>
					<p><strong>If you are a parent or carer</strong> of a young person who is self-harming, consider involving healthcare professionals. A General Practitioner (GP) will be able to review medication options, give information and resources, and refer to mental health services.</p>
					<p>There is also support available for parents of someone who is struggling - remember to take care of yourself as well. You can find support for parents on the sidebar of this page.</p>
					
					<h3>Harm reduction</h3>
					<p>It is normal to want your loved one to stop self-harming. However, pressuring them is unlikely to help. Self-harm is a coping mechanism and can be difficult to stop. Many people find harm reduction helpful while they learn other coping skills.</p>
					<p>Harm reduction is reducing the risks of self-harm. Harm reduction recognises that people struggle to stop self-harming and allows someone who doesn’t feel that they can stop to be safer and develop other coping behaviours. </p>
					<p>Harm reduction techniques may include:</p>
					<ul>
                        <li>Giving first aid advice and medical supplies to look after injuries</li>
                        <li>POffering to sit with someone who is self-harming to provide support and medical care in an emergency</li>
                        <li>Suggesting safer behaviours to replace self-harm or distract from the urge, such as pinging an elastic band against the skin</li>
						<li>Providing clean and safe instruments, such as new razors, to avoid use of used and blunt implements which carry more risk</li>
                    </ul>
