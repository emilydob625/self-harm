                <h2>Understanding Self-Harm</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <h3>What is self-harm?</h3>
                    <p>Many people think of certain behaviours as self-harm, such as cutting oneâ€™s skin or burning oneself. But there are many other behaviours that are considered self-harm, including self-neglect and risky behaviours. The definition of self-harm is <strong>behaviour with intention of harming oneself</strong>. This can include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>cutting, hitting or burning oneself</li>
                        <li>intentionally missing prescribed medication doses or purposefully taking too much</li>
                        <li>picking and scratching at skin</li>
                        <li>taking undue risk, such as overuse of alcohol, drug use, or risky sexual behaviour</li>
                        <li>over-eating or under-eating</li>
                        <li>excessive exercise</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Who self-harms?</h3>
                    <p>Anyone can show self-harming behaviour, although it is most common in adolescents and young adults. People with mental illness are more likely to self-harm, but others may also struggle with self-harming behaviour. Self-harm behaviour may be a sign that someone is struggling to cope with things at the moment.</p>
                    <h3>Why do people self-harm?</h3>
                    <p>Some people struggle to cope with their distress and feel that hurting themselves is the only way to manage their emotions.</p>
                    <div class="speech-bubble left">
                        <p>"It made me feel in control"</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="speech-bubble-container right">
                        <div class="speech-bubble right">
                            <p>"I felt angry at myself and couldn't express it"</p>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                    <p>Self-harming behaviour may be a reaction to life circumstances, a way to cope, a compulsion, or a grasp at control.</p>
                    <p>Some people may not understand why they feel the need to self-harm, or be able to name their feelings. Some people report feeling relief after self-harming, while others feel that self-harm helps them manage strong emotions such as anger or panic. Self-harm may also distract from internal pain or numbness, or be used to punish themselves for perceived shortfalls. Whatever the reason, learning what triggers an urge to self-harm can help someone learn to manage emotions without needing to use self-harm.</p>

                <h2>Harm Reduction</h2>
                <div class="section-content">
                    <p>Harm reduction refers to ways we can, in the short-term, make engaging in self-harm behaviours safer. Harm reduction recognises that people often struggle with stopping self-harming, and allows someone who doesn't feel that they can stop to be safer and take small steps to reduce their self-harming behaviour.</p>
                    <p>Harm reduction techniques may include:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Giving advice on first aid and providing medical supplies to take care of injuries</li>
                        <li>Offering to sit with someone who is self-harming to provide support and ensure that they can access medical care in an emergency</li>
                        <li>Suggesting alternative, safer behaviours to replace self-harm, such as pinging an elastic band against the skin</li>
                        <li>Providing clean and safe instruments, such as new razors, to avoid use of used or blunted implements which carry more risk</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
            </div>

                    <h3>I'm struggling, what do I do?</h3>
                    <p>It can be really difficult to open up about self-harm. Taking the step to talk to someone can be scary and it can be hard to find the words. But asking for help is your first step in accessing support.</p>
